<h2>WEB</h2>
<img src="designer.jpg" width="80%">
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1990 by the British CERN
  physicist Tim Berners-Lee.[1] On 30 April 1993,
  CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone.
  [2] Before the introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), other
  protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used
  to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple
  directory structure which the user navigates and where they choose files to
  download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without
  formatting or were encoded in word processor formats..</p>
